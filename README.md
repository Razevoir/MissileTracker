# MissileTracker
MissileTracker is a MatLab control theory project that aims to model the movement of an intercepting missile as it targets another missile.
In the current model, the linear dynamics of a point mass are used to model the interceptor.
The objective is to move the mass to a target point at a target time.
This target point represents the target missile's position at the target time, such that if the mass reaches the point at the correct time then it would have collided with the target missile.
Currently, modeling missile dynamics and target prediction are outside the scope of this project.
